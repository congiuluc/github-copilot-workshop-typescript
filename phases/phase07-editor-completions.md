## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Editor Completions

1. **Open a new file** `src/api/TaskController.ts`

2. **Write a comprehensive comment**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Task Controller for REST API endpoints
    * Handles CRUD operations, search, filtering, and task management
    * Includes authentication, validation, and error handling
    * Supports pagination, sorting, and advanced queries
    */
   ```

3. **Start typing class declaration**:
   ```typescript
   export class TaskController {
   ```

4. **Let Copilot suggest** the complete class structure including:
   - Constructor with dependencies
   - All CRUD methods
   - Search and filter methods
   - Validation and error handling

### Step 2: Generate Complete API Endpoints

1. **Add method comment** and let Copilot complete the entire implementation:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * GET /api/tasks
    * Retrieves tasks with pagination, filtering, and sorting
    * Supports query parameters: page, limit, status, priority, assignedTo, project
    * Returns paginated results with metadata
    */
   async getTasks(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
   ```

2. **Expected Copilot completion** (let it generate the full method):
   ```typescript
   async getTasks(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
     try {
       // Extract query parameters with defaults
       const page = parseInt(req.query.page as string) || 1;
       const limit = Math.min(parseInt(req.query.limit as string) || 10, 100);
       const status = req.query.status as TaskStatus;
       const priority = req.query.priority as TaskPriority;
       const assignedTo = req.query.assignedTo as string;
       const projectId = req.query.project as string;
       const sortBy = req.query.sortBy as string || 'createdAt';
       const sortOrder = req.query.sortOrder as 'asc' | 'desc' || 'desc';
       
       // Build filter criteria
       const filterCriteria: TaskFilterCriteria = {
         status,
         priority,
         assignedTo,
         projectId
       };
       
       // Remove undefined values
       Object.keys(filterCriteria).forEach(key => 
         filterCriteria[key] === undefined && delete filterCriteria[key]
       );
       
       // Get tasks with pagination
       const result = await this.taskService.getTasks({
         page,
         limit,
         filter: filterCriteria,
         sort: { field: sortBy, order: sortOrder }
       });
       
       // Prepare response
       const response = {
         data: result.tasks,
         meta: {
           page,
           limit,
           total: result.total,
           totalPages: Math.ceil(result.total / limit),
           hasNext: page < Math.ceil(result.total / limit),
           hasPrev: page > 1
         }
       };
       
       res.status(200).json(response);
       
     } catch (error) {
       this.handleError(error, res);
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Generate Complex Search Implementation

1. **Add advanced search method**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * POST /api/tasks/search
    * Advanced task search with full-text search, filters, and aggregations
    * Supports complex queries, date ranges, and custom criteria
    * Returns results with search highlighting and facets
    */
   async searchTasks(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
   ```

2. **Let Copilot generate** the complete search implementation including:
   - Text search across multiple fields
   - Date range filtering
   - Complex boolean queries
   - Result ranking and highlighting
   - Search facets and aggregations

### Step 4: Implement Data Analytics Endpoints

1. **Create analytics controller** `src/api/AnalyticsController.ts`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Analytics Controller for task management insights
    * Provides dashboard data, reports, and performance metrics
    * Includes real-time statistics and historical trends
    */
   export class AnalyticsController {
   ```

2. **Add dashboard data method**:

    * Supports real-time processing and batch operations
    */
   export class DataProcessor {
   ```

2. **Add complex processing method**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Processes task completion data to generate productivity insights
    * Calculates completion rates, average times, bottlenecks, and trends
    * Groups data by user, project, time period, and task type
    * Identifies patterns and provides recommendations
    */
   async processProductivityData(timeRange: DateRange): Promise<ProductivityReport> {
   ```

3. **Let Copilot generate** the entire data processing pipeline

### Step 6: Implement Complex Business Logic

1. **Create task assignment algorithm** in `src/services/TaskAssignmentService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Intelligent task assignment service
    * Automatically assigns tasks based on workload, skills, availability, and priorities
    * Uses scoring algorithm to find optimal assignments
    * Considers dependencies, deadlines, and team capacity
    */
   export class TaskAssignmentService {
   ```

2. **Add auto-assignment method**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Automatically assigns task to the most suitable team member
    * Algorithm considers:
    * - Current workload and capacity
    * - Skills match and experience level
    * - Availability and schedule
    * - Past performance and success rate
    * - Task complexity and priority
    * Returns assignment recommendation with confidence score
    */
   async findOptimalAssignment(task: Task): Promise<AssignmentRecommendation> {
   ```

3. **Let Copilot implement** the complete assignment algorithm

### Step 7: Generate Integration Services

1. **Create external service integration** `src/integrations/NotificationService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Multi-channel notification service
    * Sends notifications via email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app alerts
    * Handles template management, user preferences, and delivery tracking
    * Supports batch notifications and retry mechanisms
    */
   export class NotificationService {
   ```

2. **Add comprehensive notification method**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Sends task-related notifications to relevant stakeholders
    * Automatically determines recipients based on task context
    * Chooses appropriate channels based on urgency and user preferences
    * Handles delivery failures and retry logic
    * Tracks delivery status and engagement metrics
    */
   async notifyTaskUpdate(task: Task, updateType: TaskUpdateType, context: NotificationContext): Promise<NotificationResult> {
   ```

### Step 8: Implement Caching Strategy

1. **Create cache service** `src/services/CacheService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Intelligent caching service for task management system
    * Implements multi-level caching with automatic invalidation
    * Supports memory cache, Redis, and browser cache strategies
    * Handles cache warming, compression, and performance monitoring
    */
   export class CacheService {
   ```

2. **Add smart caching method**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Intelligent caching with automatic invalidation and warming
    * Determines optimal cache strategy based on data access patterns
    * Handles cache dependencies and cascading invalidation
    * Supports cache tagging and selective clearing
    * Monitors hit rates and performance metrics
    */
   async smartCache<T>(key: string, generator: () => Promise<T>, options: CacheOptions): Promise<T> {
   ```

### Step 9: Generate Validation Framework

1. **Create validation service** `src/validation/ValidationService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Comprehensive validation framework for task management
    * Supports schema validation, business rules, and custom validators
    * Provides detailed error messages and field-level feedback
    * Handles async validation and cross-field dependencies
    */
   export class ValidationService {
   ```

2. **Add complex validation method**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Validates complete task workflow including dependencies, constraints, and business rules
    * Checks task assignments, deadlines, resource availability, and project constraints
    * Validates user permissions, project status, and team capacity
    * Returns comprehensive validation result with suggestions for fixes
    */
   async validateTaskWorkflow(workflow: TaskWorkflow): Promise<WorkflowValidationResult> {
   ```

### Step 10: Implement Real-time Features

1. **Create real-time service** `src/realtime/RealtimeService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Real-time communication service for live updates
    * Handles WebSocket connections, event broadcasting, and subscription management
    * Supports room-based messaging, user presence, and live collaboration
    * Includes connection recovery, message ordering, and conflict resolution
    */
   export class RealtimeService {
   ```

2. **Add live collaboration method**:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * Enables real-time collaboration on tasks and projects
    * Broadcasts updates to relevant users instantly
    * Handles concurrent editing, conflict resolution, and operational transformation
    * Manages user presence, cursor tracking, and live annotations
    * Ensures data consistency across all connected clients
    */
   async enableLiveCollaboration(entityId: string, entityType: CollaborationType): Promise<CollaborationSession> {
   ```

## üéØ Tips for Better Editor Completions

### Write Descriptive Comments:
```typescript
/**
 * Detailed description of what the method does
 * Include input parameters, expected outputs
 * Mention business rules and constraints
 * Describe error conditions and edge cases
 */
```

### Use Meaningful Names:
```typescript
// Good: specific and descriptive
async generateMonthlyProductivityReport(userId: string, month: Date): Promise<ProductivityReport>

// Less effective: vague and generic
async generateReport(id: string, date: Date): Promise<any>
```

### Provide Context with Interfaces:
```typescript
interface TaskAssignmentCriteria {
  skillRequirements: string[];
  priorityLevel: TaskPriority;
  estimatedHours: number;
  deadline: Date;
  projectId: string;
}
```
