- Set up configuration management
- Get code reviews for Phase 1 models

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Copilot Chat

1. **Open Copilot Chat** in VS Code:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+I` (Mac)
   - Or click the chat icon in the Activity Bar
   - Or use Command Palette: `> GitHub Copilot: Open Chat`

2. **Verify Chat is Working**:
   ```
   Hello! Can you help me with TypeScript development?
   ```

### Step 2: Architecture Design Session

**Use these specific prompts in Copilot Chat:**

1. **Initial Architecture Prompt**:
   ```
   I'm building a task management application in TypeScript. I have basic models (Task, User, Project) and need to design a clean architecture. What layers should I implement and how should they interact? Consider SOLID principles and TypeScript best practices.
   ```

2. **Follow-up Architecture Questions**:
   ```
   Based on your suggestions, how should I structure my repository pattern for data access? Should I use interfaces or abstract classes for my repositories?
   ```

3. **Service Layer Design**:
   ```
   Design a service layer for my task management app. What services do I need and how should they depend on each other? Show me TypeScript interfaces for the main services.
   ```

### Step 3: Create Interfaces Based on Chat Recommendations

1. **Create** `src/interfaces/repositories.ts`

2. **Ask Copilot Chat**:
   ```
   Generate TypeScript interfaces for repositories in my task management system. Include TaskRepository, UserRepository, and ProjectRepository with CRUD operations and specific query methods.
   ```

3. **Apply the suggested code** to your file

4. **Create** `src/interfaces/services.ts`

5. **Ask Copilot Chat**:
   ```
   Create service interfaces for TaskService, UserService, and ProjectService. Include business logic methods like assignTask, createProject, getUserTasks, etc.
   ```

### Step 4: Configuration and Constants

1. **Ask Copilot Chat**:
   ```
   I need a configuration system for my TypeScript app. Create a config structure that includes database settings, logging levels, and application constants. Use environment variables and provide TypeScript types.
   ```

2. **Create** `src/config/index.ts` with the suggested configuration

3. **Ask for constants**:
   ```
   Generate application constants for my task management system including default values, validation rules, and error messages.
   ```

4. **Create** `src/constants/index.ts` with the suggestions

### Step 5: Error Handling Strategy

1. **Ask Copilot Chat**:
   ```
   Design a comprehensive error handling strategy for my TypeScript application. Include custom error classes, error codes, and a centralized error handler. Show me how to implement domain-specific errors for task management.
   ```

2. **Create** `src/errors/index.ts` based on recommendations

3. **Follow-up question**:
   ```
   How should I implement validation errors specifically? Show me TypeScript classes for validation errors with field-level details.
   ```

### Step 6: Code Review Session

1. **Open your Task model** from Phase 1

2. **Ask Copilot Chat to review it**:
   ```
   @workspace Review my Task model class for TypeScript best practices, potential improvements, and missing functionality. Suggest enhancements for better maintainability and type safety.
   ```

3. **Ask for specific improvements**:
   ```
   How can I improve the constructor and method implementations in my Task class? Consider immutability, validation, and error handling.
   ```

4. **Repeat for User and Project models**:
   ```
   @workspace Review my User and Project models. Are there any design patterns I should apply? How can I make them more robust?
   ```

### Step 7: Design Patterns Discussion

1. **Ask about patterns**:
   ```
   Which design patterns would be most beneficial for my task management application? Explain how to implement Observer pattern for task updates and Factory pattern for creating different task types.
   ```

2. **Request specific implementation**:
   ```
   Show me how to implement the Observer pattern in TypeScript for notifying when task status changes. Include proper typing and event handling.
   ```

3. **Ask about dependency injection**:
   ```
   How should I implement dependency injection in my TypeScript application without using a framework? Show me a simple DI container implementation.
   ```

## üéØ Specific Chat Prompts to Use

### Architecture Questions:
```
What's the best way to structure a TypeScript project for scalability and maintainability?
```

### Code Review Prompts:
```
@workspace Review this code for potential issues and improvements
```

### Best Practices:
```
What TypeScript best practices should I follow for enterprise applications?
```

### Design Patterns:
```
Which creational patterns work well with TypeScript's type system?
```

### Performance:
```
How can I optimize TypeScript code for better performance in a Node.js environment?
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

After completing this phase, you should have:

1. **Clear architecture document** based on Chat recommendations
2. **Repository interfaces** with proper TypeScript typing
3. **Service interfaces** for business logic layer
4. **Configuration system** with environment variable support
5. **Error handling classes** with custom error types
6. **Improved models** based on code review feedback
7. **Design pattern implementations** for key functionality

### Example Repository Interface:
```typescript
export interface TaskRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<Task | null>;
  findByUserId(userId: string): Promise<Task[]>;
  findByProjectId(projectId: string): Promise<Task[]>;
  create(task: Omit<Task, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>): Promise<Task>;
  update(id: string, updates: Partial<Task>): Promise<Task>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
  findOverdue(): Promise<Task[]>;
}
```

## üí° Copilot Chat Tips

5. **Ask for explanations** to understand the reasoning
6. **Use Chat for debugging** complex issues

## üß™ Advanced Chat Exercises

   Compare layered architecture vs. hexagonal architecture for my task management app. Which would be better and why?
   ```

2. **Performance Analysis**:
   ```
   @workspace Analyze my models for potential performance bottlenecks. How can I optimize them?
   ```

3. **Security Review**:
   ```
   What security considerations should I implement in my TypeScript task management application?
   ```
